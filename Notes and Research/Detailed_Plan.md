## Chatbot for Computer Science

*Below will be the detailed plan for implementation onto the VCU  website.

1) Using SQlite build a database that will hold information regarding courses, computer science organizations, and computer science professors.
  - See database code here <>
  - 
2) User Interface: Add HTML to the vcu pages that we want the chatbot to appear under
  - See HTML here <>
  - 
3) Backend:
- See python code here <>
- Build python program that will be responsible for sending user question to NLP for processing and return of key words
- Use key words to query a database to find all relevant information (this can be improved with word embedding if we have time)
- Take the information that was returned from the database and format it into a conversational response, send to chatbot (user)
    - We can either use the NLP to format a friendly response or we can have templates and fill them in with the information because the NLP will end up costing money.
